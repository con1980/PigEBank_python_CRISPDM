# PigEBank_python_CRISPDM
Data mining - CRISP-DM methodology - Decision tree - Python</br >
The purpose of this project was to answer some business questions of PigEBank which was concerned about customers leaving their bank and they wanted to know why.

# Introduction
One of the data analysts for the sales team recently left Pig E. Bank, so you’ve agreed to take their place and help out with a customer retention project.
To increase customer retention, the sales team wants to identify the leading indicators that a customer will leave the bank. 
You’ve created a table of client attributes that you believe could indicate whether customers will leave—for example, age, estimated salary, etc. 
You’re going to use this information to identify the top risk factors that contribute to client loss and model them in a decision tree.

# Key Questions
- What are the top 4 main reasons why customers leave the bank
- Produce a decision tree to evaluate the likelyhood that customers leave the bank based on certain conditions.

# Data
The following data sets was the basis to work with:
  - 5.4-PigEBank-Client-Data set.xlsx

# Tools
I used python to load, clean, analyze and produce visualizations with the following libraries:
- pandas -> Data analysis
- numpy -> Mathematical equations
- os -> interact with operating system
- matplotlib.pyplot -> visualizations
- seaborn -> visulaizations
- scipy -> scientific equations
- sklearn -> learning algorythms to produce decision tree
